# Hiding in data

Experimenting with moving 
[What's hiding in data](https://hidingindata.wordpress.com/)
and stuff from Wordpress over here.

And possibly starting to blog

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

But mainly experimenting with Jekyll and GitHub.
