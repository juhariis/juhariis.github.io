# A start

It appears that publishing R and Pythion related documents
should be far easier on GitHub than on WordPress.

The first attempt to generate GitHub / Jekyll compatible markup
file from R-Studio was not yet successfull.

But I trust I will get it done. 
Only have to add some blood and sweat.
A few curses and magic spells.

But it will work out.

So I'm moving over here.
