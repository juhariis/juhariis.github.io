# An update

Quite some time has passed since the first modest post over here.
I've been busy with other very interesting and time consuming but rewarding 
activities in the field of data analytics. And then there is life as well.

Recently I was participating a climate service course organizwed by 
[Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) and [FMI](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/) where 
we experimented with
climate data and investigated [how strawberry farming in Finland might evolve over the 
ongoing century](https://github.com/juhariis/cds-fin-strawberry).

It was a toy project with limited time to make a deep and thoughtful analysis
so I would not use those results for real.
Perhaps with some additional work and more variables supported by 
expertise in strawberries could make a difference.

That required quite some coding in Python and sharing the results with the team was 
only natural via GitHub.
And brought me back here again. 
And resulted in having to make some badly needed house keeping as well.

I'm not planning to blog here regularly, but perhaps a bit more often than before.
